abstract = {The growth of the biological nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) field and the development of new experimental technology have mandated the revision and enlargement of the NMR-STAR ontology used to represent experiments, spectral and derived data, and supporting metadata. We present here a brief description of the NMR-STAR ontology and software tools for manipulating NMR-STAR data files, editing the files, extracting selected data, and creating data visualizations. Detailed information on these is accessible from the links provided.},
