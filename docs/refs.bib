abstract = {The growth of the biological nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) field and the development of new experimental technology have mandated the revision and enlargement of the NMR-STAR ontology used to represent experiments, spectral and derived data, and supporting metadata. We present here a brief description of the NMR-STAR ontology and software tools for manipulating NMR-STAR data files, editing the files, extracting selected data, and creating data visualizations. Detailed information on these is accessible from the links provided.},

    abstract = "{ The BioMagResBank (BMRB: www.bmrb.wisc.edu ) is a repository for experimental and derived data gathered from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic studies of biological molecules. BMRB is a partner in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). The BMRB archive consists of four main data depositories: (i) quantitative NMR spectral parameters for proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and ligands or cofactors (assigned chemical shifts, coupling constants and peak lists) and derived data (relaxation parameters, residual dipolar couplings, hydrogen exchange rates, pK a values, etc.), (ii) databases for NMR restraints processed from original author depositions available from the Protein Data Bank, (iii) time-domain (raw) spectral data from NMR experiments used to assign spectral resonances and determine the structures of biological macromolecules and (iv) a database of one- and two-dimensional 1 H and 13 C one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra for over 250 metabolites. The BMRB website provides free access to all of these data. BMRB has tools for querying the archive and retrieving information and an ftp site (ftp.bmrb.wisc.edu) where data in the archive can be downloaded in bulk. Two BMRB mirror sites exist: one at the PDBj, Protein Research Institute, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan (bmrb.protein.osaka-u.ac.jp) and the other at CERM, University of Florence, Florence, Italy (bmrb.postgenomicnmr.net/). The site at Osaka also accepts and processes data depositions. }",

@incollection{Romero2020,
abstract = {The Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BioMagResBank or BMRB), founded in 1988, serves as the archive for data generated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of biological systems. NMR spectroscopy is unique among biophysical approaches in its ability to provide a broad range of atomic and higher-level information relevant to the structural, dynamic, and chemical properties of biological macromolecules, as well as report on metabolite and natural product concentrations in complex mixtures and their chemical structures. BMRB became a core member of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) in 2007, and the BMRB archive is now a core archive of the wwPDB. Currently, about 10% of the structures deposited into the PDB archive are based on NMR spectroscopy. BMRB stores experimental and derived data from biomolecular NMR studies. Newer BMRB biopolymer depositions are divided about evenly between those associated with structure determinations (atomic coordinates and supporting information archived in the PDB) and those reporting experimental information on molecular dynamics, conformational transitions, ligand binding, assigned chemical shifts, or other results from NMR spectroscopy. BMRB also provides resources for NMR studies of metabolites and other small molecules that are often macromolecular ligands and/or nonstandard residues. This chapter is directed to the structural biology community rather than the metabolomics and natural products community. Our goal is to describe various BMRB services offered to structural biology researchers and how they can be accessed and utilized. These services can be classified into four main groups: (1) data deposition, (2) data retrieval, (3) data analysis, and (4) services for NMR spectroscopists and software developers. The chapter also describes the NMR-STAR data format used by BMRB and the tools provided to facilitate its use. For programmers, BMRB offers an application programming interface (API) and libraries in the Python and R languages that enable users to develop their own BMRB-based tools for data analysis, visualization, and manipulation of NMR-STAR formatted files. BMRB also provides users with direct access tools through the NMRbox platform.},
